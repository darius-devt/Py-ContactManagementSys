# Contact Management System

## Description

Create a Python program that simulates a contact management system.

The program should allow users to perform the following actions:

1. **Add a contact**: Allows the user to add a contact to the list of contacts. Contacts must have attributes such as:
   - Name
   - Phone number
   - Email
2. **Show all contacts**: Displays a list of all available contacts.
3. **Search for a contact**: Allows the user to search for a contact by name.
4. **Delete a contact**: Allows the user to delete a contact from the list.

---

## Requirements

- Use **classes** to represent contacts and the contact management system.
- Implement methods to **add**, **display**, **search**, and **delete** contacts.
- Use **control structures and loops** to handle interaction with the user.
- Use **file handling** to save and load the contact list in a text file.
- Implement **error handling** to manage situations such as:
  - Adding a contact with an **invalid email format**.
  - Attempting to **search for or delete** a contact that does not exist.
  - Errors when **reading or writing** to the file.
